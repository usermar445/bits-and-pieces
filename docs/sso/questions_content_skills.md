# Questions Content & Skills

**Hypothesis testing**

- Is the p-value the probability?
- In which case do you choose $H_1: \neq < >$? And which test does that lead to (left-sided, right-sided, two-sided)?
- In which cases is the confidence interval method the same? And which not? And why?
- How to you choose the confidence level given a certain $\alpha$? Is it always two-sided?
- How do you get $z_{\alpha/2}$ from a table? How do you get $t$ values from the table?
- What is the power of a test? How does it relate to other parameters? What does it express?
- How to read the $t$-table for a confidence interval (is it then two-sided)?

**Two sample testing**

**Sign test**  

- How to decide if sample contradicts $H_1$?
- How to decide if a test in two-sided or one-sided for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test?

**Contingency tables**  

- why is $\chi^2$ test always right-sided?


**Correlation**

- How to check if there is correlation?


**Is the p-value the probability?**  
The $p$-value (or *probability value*) is the probability of getting a value of the test statistic that is at least as 
extreme as the one representing the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. So, yes.
