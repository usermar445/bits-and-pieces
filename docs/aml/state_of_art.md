# State of the Art 

## Transformers 
((see Architecture))

## Generative machine learning
**Discriminative vs. Generative**

- Discriminative: Classification, Regression
- Discriminative: $p(X \vert X)$
- Generative: $p(X)$, generating

**History**

- Auto-Encoders: 
- Variational Auto-Encoders
- Generative Adversarial Networks: discriminator and generator -> trained to recognize which one is fake (but hard to optimize)
- Diffusion Models: take image and slowly disintegrate into noise; then you can go back

## Power of Scale

## Graph machine learning
Graph convolutions

## Self-supervised machine learning
