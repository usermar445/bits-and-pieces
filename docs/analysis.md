# Analysis

## Sanity Checks
Check if something went wrong through invariant metrics: 

- population sizing metrics
- metrics that should not change


## Single Metrics
Method: 

- run sanity checks
- calculate confidence interval (if necessary, SE empirically)
- to sign test or binomial test

**What if sign test and hypothesis test do not agree?**  
Simpson's paradox: if you have subgroups that behave differently; be aware: for example new users might behave differently compared to experienced users.
