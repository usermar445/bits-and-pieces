# Probability basics

*Based on Jim Pitman - Probability (2012)*

## Introduction

**Basic notions** 

- Outcome space: $\Omega$, e.g. $\Omega = \{head, tail\}$
- Events
- probability
 

**Interpretation**

- Frequency interpretation
- Subjective probabilities


**Distributions**

- Bernoulli distribution: two possible outcomes with probability $p$
- Uniform distribution (finite set): $P(B)=#(B)/n$
- Uniform $(a,b)$ distribution: picking a point on an interval, *standard normal* between $(0,1)$; probabilities defined by relative length
- Uniform distributions in a plane

**Empirical Distributions**
