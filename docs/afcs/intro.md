# Intro

**Complex system:** System composed of many components that interact, hard to predict intrinsically because e.g.
dependencies, etc.

**Qualitative vs. quantitative**:  (if numerical about past and reasonable to assume it will continue)


**Forecasting vs. prediction**: forecasting is time-based prediction (not all prediction is forecasting)

**Time-series forecasting**: everything that is observed sequentially over time

**Explanatory model vs. time-series model vs. mixed-models**
