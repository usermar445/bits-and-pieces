# Probability

## What this notebook is about
The goal is to give an introduction to probability theory used in statistics.

## Typical introductions to probability theory
Typical statistics textbook usually has the following contents when it comes to probability:

- Combinatorics
- Maye some basics of probability (space, events, etc.) with some remarks about sampling
- Random Variables
- Discrete Distributions
- Continuous Distributions
- Conditional Probability and Joint Distributions
- More distributions
- Expectations and other measures
- Some remarks about interpretations of probability
- Some remarks about law of large numbers or central limit theorem

The problem with such structures is that the parts seem rather disconnected, in 
the sense that it often struck me as a collection of "things you can do with probability"
without any motivation, relation, and missing the bigger picture. It's directed at
things you do than actual understanding of the why. Futhermore, with every new concept, 
and for sure when the textbooks proceed to the statistics part, I asked myself often
*why* we need this or want this and overall *what* we were doing here. 

More mathematical introductions help in that respect but seem only to cover parts of it 
and usually mix up the timeline of the introduction of these concepts.
